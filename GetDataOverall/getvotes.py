"""
This code gets and saves all votes from the API to JSON,
The max amount of vote records the api holds is 10000, so
we go through 100 at a time until skip == 10000, after that
all records are successfully saved and prepared for the API,
The code shown is reused for the other 3 sections of data,
excluding lobbying.
